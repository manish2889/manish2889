## 01. About Me

My journey into the world of blockchain and Web3 began with a fascination for decentralized systems and their potential to revolutionize the digital landscape. As a computer science student, I've always been drawn to cutting-edge technologies that challenge traditional paradigms.

Beyond coding, I'm passionate about contributing to the Web3 ecosystem and building solutions that make blockchain technology more accessible to everyone. I believe in the power of decentralized systems to create a more transparent and equitable digital future.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new blockchain protocols, participating in hackathons, or sharing my knowledge with the developer community through technical articles and open-source contributions.
